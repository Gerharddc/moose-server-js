# moose-server-js
Server for 3D printer web interface

This is the server side component of the 3D printer web interface at https://github.com/Gerharddc/moose-web and needs to be running on an embedded Linux computer connected to a RepRap 3D printer.

This project is not 100% complete and is not being maintened but does work and can be probably extended to something really useful.
